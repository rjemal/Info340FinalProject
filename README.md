    Finding A Community
    
    - Users are able to find existing communities abroad by simply clicking the find community tab.
    - Users are able to find communities by selecting they city they are living in abroad and have the option of adding additional tags to help find specific communities they are     
      interested in
    - Those who join a community are able to see things such as planned hangouts, advice,
      resturant recommendations, and hostel reviews by other like minded peoople in the community
    - Users are also able to post comments in the section listed above.
      
    Creating A Community
    
    - If users don't find a community they want to join they are able to simply create a   
      community based off of the city they are abroad in.
    - In order to make it easy for others to understand what the new community is the user must 
      insert a city, country, title, and description as well as an image placeholder for the new community to make it easy to understand so that others will join.
